# AI Generated Content Filter for Steam

Steam is increasingly populated by games utilizing AI-generated art and assets. While Valve requires developers to disclose this in a specific "AI Generated Content Disclosure" section, this information is often buried at the bottom of the page or completely invisible in search results.

AI Generated Content Filter for Steam brings this information to the forefront. It automatically scans store pages and search results to detect the mandatory AI disclosure text, giving you the transparency you need before you click or buy.

This extension runs entirely locally on your browser. It does not collect user data, track your browsing history, or communicate with external servers. It only reads the text on store.steampowered.com to check for specific disclosure strings.

Please send an email if you encounter any issues or bugs with the extension.
